      <h3> A Short History </h2>
        <p>
          Pizza was first document AD 997 in Southern Italy.
Modern pizza developed in Naples, when tomato was added to the focaccia in the late 18th century. However, pizza was mainly eaten in the province of Italy and by immigrants from there. This changed after World War II, when Allied Troops stationed in Italy developed a love for Pizza.

The first printed reference to "pizza" served in the us is a 1904 article in The Boston Journal. Giovanni Bruno came to America from Naples and in 1903 and introduced Neapolitan pizza, his son later opened the first pizzeria in Chicago.
